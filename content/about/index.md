## About 

Learn with O.J. is my public notebook as I earn a B.S. in Computer Science (and later an M.S. in CS) the practical way: by building, breaking, and explaining as I go. I’m Olivia (“O.J.”), a senior SRE/software engineer and Computer Science student who believes the fastest way to master something is to teach it clearly.

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

## What you’ll find here

* Course-aligned guides: Calculus I, Discrete Math I, Java Fundamentals, Data Structures & Algorithms I, Data Management/SQL, Computer Architecture, Version Control (Git), Scripting & Programming Applications, Software Engineering, Intro to AI for CS, Network & Security Foundations, Fundamentals of Information Security, and Systems Thinking.
* Certification notes: LPI Linux Essentials, CompTIA Network+ (and other foundational certs as they make sense).
* SRE-flavored context: Reliability principles, incident-ready habits, and “how this shows up in real systems.”
* Study assets: Plain-English summaries, worked examples, visual cheatsheets, flashcard decks, and practice prompts.
* Builds & lab walkthroughs: Small projects that apply concepts (e.g., writing a simple cache, visualizing graph algorithms, containerizing a Java app, or modeling reliability math).

## My learning style

* **Concept first, code second:** I start with the “why,” then move to minimal, readable examples.
* **No gatekeeping:** If something confused me, I’ll show the rough draft that made it click.
* **Repeatable paths:** I publish step-by-step labs you can run locally (with setup notes and gotchas).
* **Career-friendly framing:** I connect theory to decisions engineers make on-call, in reviews, and in design docs.

## Who this is for

* Self-taught or returning learners who want CS foundations without fluff.
* Engineers moving toward reliability, platform, or backend roles.
* Students who prefer pragmatic, example-driven explanations.

## How to use this site

Click the category in the top nav bar to browse related posts. You can also jump straight to a course you’re taking. Each article links to prerequisites, next steps, and practice.

PS: I don’t cover everything, only what I’ve tested, used, or can explain simply. If you spot an error, please comment. Learning in public works best when we sharpen each other.
